# HotelReservation Blueprint
There plenty of examples of different of microservices that utilize .Net Core as platform. These are documented quite well by Microsoft EShopContainers Microfrontend blueprints.
For Python implementaiton there seems to be scarcity of examples.  The one notable exception, is a book by Harry Percival and Bob Gregoory  -  Architecture Patterns with Python that is an example of microfrontends and microservices
utilizing Flask API.  These examples have provided an inspiration for creation of a fictional Hotel Reservation microservices application that utilizes FastApi instead and provides a deployment scenario to Azure Kubrernettes.
